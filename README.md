# Simon Memory Game

## Overview

Simon Memory Game where players memorize an increasing sequence of colours. 
This is a walkthrough project as part of my Full Stack Web Development diploma with Code Institute, and it marked my first experience building a project with comprehensive testing using Jest.
Throughout the project, I learned key concepts such as test-driven development (TDD), testing the DOM and its events, and how to expose values from functions to make them testable, even when they don’t return a value.
It’s been eye-opening to see how much more robust even small projects can become with proper testing.
